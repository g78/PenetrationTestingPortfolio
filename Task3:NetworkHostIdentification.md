# Task 3: Network Host Identification

## Ping Sweeps
One way to do this is to do a ICMP ping sweep of the network noting which hosts respond.  The tool I use for this particular task is NMAP
**Command:** *nmap -sP 172.31.6.0-254*

Its always good to corroborate the results so I like to use different tools and compare, the second example is to use IP Crawl

And lastly one of the best tools I have come across - Propecia
